/**
 * Type system.
 *
 * Three faces doing three jobs — headline, text, data — rather than one
 * neutral grotesk doing everything, which is what makes a site read as
 * generic.
 *
 * Sora carries the headlines: a geometric sans with slightly squared bowls
 * and open counters, which stays crisp and bright at large sizes rather than
 * turning into a heavy slab. Manrope sets body copy — rounded, generously
 * spaced and very legible over imagery. Roboto Mono carries numbers, units and
 * field labels, where the tabular figures matter more than personality.
